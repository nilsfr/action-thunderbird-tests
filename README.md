Thunderbird Tests Action
========================

![Build Status](https://github.com/kewisch/action-thunderbird-tests/workflows/Thunderbird%20Tests%20Action/badge.svg)

This is a Github Action to run Thunderbird tests, for example if you want to create an xpcshell test
for your add-on. It makes use of the test packages generated by Thunderbird itself.

Supplying the GITHUB_TOKEN is neccessary to create annotations for the commit to show where tests failed.

Configuration
-------------

The following config runs xpcshell tests using the manifest from `test/xpcshell/xpcshell.ini` from
within your repository. It makes sure Lightning is enabled and uses the nightly channel (both
default config options)

```yaml
  test:
    name: "Tests"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: "Checkout"
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: "Run Tests"
        uses: kewisch/action-thunderbird-tests@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          lightning: true
          channel: nightly
          xpcshell: test/xpcshell/xpcshell.ini
```

xpcshell is currently the only supported test harness, though support for mochitests or mozharness
could be viable.
